# Python Flask Course

This repository contains my homwwork for the python flask course by [Tero Karvinen](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/python-web-service-from-idea-to-production/)

The main focus of these exercises is the backend code so while the apps are not visually impressive the are very functional.
